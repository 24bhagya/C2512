Problem Statement:

   -  The task is to create, compile, and execute a simple C++ program that interacts with the user. 
   - Initially, the program takes a user's name as input and greets them with a welcome message. 
   - The program is later modified to also include a farewell message.
   - finally,to remove the file and also to remove the directory.

What is the nano editor?

  - The nano editor is a simple, command-line-based text editor commonly used on Linux systems. 
  - It is beginner-friendly and ideal for quickly editing text files, programming scripts, or configuration files directly from the terminal. 
  - Unlike other editors such as vim, nano has a straightforward interface with on-screen shortcuts for saving, exiting, and navigating.
  - Comes pre-installed on most Linux distributions.


STEPS  :

1. Create a new directory
   -- mkdir my_cpp_project

2. Change into the directory 
   -- cd my_cpp_project

3. Create a C++ file
   -- touch greet.cpp

4. Write the C++ program
Open the file using nano:
   ---nano greet.cpp

Write the following code inside greet.cpp:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    char name[20];
    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    cin >> name;
    cout << "Hello, " << name << "! Welcome!" << endl;
    return 0;
}

To save the file in nano:
   --Press Ctrl + O to save.
Press Enter to confirm the filename.
   ---Press Ctrl + X to exit.

5. Compile the program
Used g++ to compile:
   -- g++ greet.cpp

6. Run the executable
   -- ./a.out

7. Display the contents of the file:
   -- cat greet.cpp

8. Modify the file

Open greet.cpp again with nano:
   ---nano greet.cpp

Modify the code to include a farewell message:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    char name[20];
    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    cin >> name;
    cout << "Hello, " << name << "! Welcome!" << endl;
    cout << "Goodbye, " << name << "! Have a great day!" << endl;
    return 0;
}

Save and exit:

   ---Press Ctrl + O, Enter to save.
   ----Press Ctrl + X to exit.

9. Compile and run the modified program 

Compile the updated file:
   ---g++ greet.cpp

Run the executable again:
   -- ./a.out

10. Remove the greet.cpp file

   -- rm greet.cpp

11. Check and remove the directory if itâ€™s empty

List the directory contents:
   --  ls
If the directory is empty, remove it:
   -- cd ..
   -- rmdir my_cpp_project
