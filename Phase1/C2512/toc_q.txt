## 1. **Introduction to Programming**
   - Programming involves writing code to solve problems and execute tasks using a computer.
   - It includes learning the syntax and logic of a programming language to develop software applications.
   - Programming is an essential skill for creating everything from simple scripts to complex systems.

---

## 2. **Machine Language**
   - Machine language is the lowest-level programming language that a computer can understand, composed of binary code.
   - It directly controls the computer’s hardware and is specific to the processor’s architecture.
   - Programs written in machine language are very fast but hard to write and debug.

---

## 3. **Assembly Language and Assembler**
   - Assembly language is a low-level programming language that uses symbolic names (mnemonics) for machine-level instructions.
   - It is specific to the computer’s architecture and provides a more human-readable format than machine language.
   - An assembler is a tool that converts assembly language code into machine code.

---

## 4. **Linker**
   - A linker is a program that combines multiple object files generated by a compiler into a single executable file.
   - It resolves references between different code modules and libraries.
   - The linker ensures that all external functions and variables are correctly connected.

---

## 5. **High-Level Language, Interpreters and Compilers**
   - High-level languages (like C++, Python) are user-friendly and abstract the details of the machine’s hardware.
   - An interpreter directly executes instructions line by line without generating an intermediate machine code file.
   - A compiler translates the entire program into machine code or intermediate code before execution.

---

## 6. **Problem Solving Techniques**
   - **Top-down Approach**: Break the problem into smaller subproblems.
   - **Divide and Conquer**: Divide the problem into smaller subproblems, solve each, and combine results.
   - **Trial and Error**: Test multiple solutions until the correct one is found.

---

## 7. **Algorithm**
   - An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem.
   - It must be finite, unambiguous, and provide a solution within a reasonable amount of time.
   - Algorithms are the foundation of problem-solving in computer science.

---

## 8. **Flowchart**
   - A flowchart is a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, using symbols to represent operations.
   - It helps in visualizing the flow of control and logic in a program.
   - Flowcharts use standard symbols such as ovals, rectangles, and diamonds to denote various actions and decisions.

---

## 9. **Pseudocode**
   - Pseudocode is a human-readable description of the steps in an algorithm.
   - It combines natural language and programming logic to outline the flow without focusing on specific syntax.
   - It is useful for planning before writing actual code.

---

## 10. **Hello World Program using C++**
   ```cpp
   #include <iostream>
   using namespace std;
   int main() {
       cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
       return 0;
   }
   ```
   - This program outputs "Hello, World!" to the console.
   - It demonstrates the basic structure of a C++ program.
   - The `#include <iostream>` is used to include the standard I/O library.

---

## 11. **Introduction to C++ IDE (Visual Studio Code Preferred)**
   - Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular, lightweight, and customizable code editor.
   - It supports C++ development with extensions like "C++" and "Code Runner" for compiling and running code.
   - Features like debugging, IntelliSense (code suggestions), and version control make it ideal for C++ programming.

---

## 12. **Variables and Constants**
   - **Variables** store data that can change during program execution, defined with a specific type (e.g., int, float).
   - **Constants** are values that do not change during program execution and are often declared using the `const` keyword.
   - Using constants helps prevent accidental modification of important values in a program.

---

## 13. **Enum**
   - An `enum` (enumeration) is a user-defined data type consisting of integral constants.
   - It improves code readability by assigning names to constant values.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     enum Day { Sunday, Monday, Tuesday };
     ```

---

## 14. **C++ Coding Standards**
   - Consistently use meaningful variable names for clarity.
   - Follow proper indentation to enhance readability.
   - Comment complex logic to improve maintainability.

---

## 15. **Assignment Operator**
   - The assignment operator `=` is used to assign a value to a variable.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     int a = 5;
     ```
   - It copies the value on the right side into the variable on the left side.

---

## 16. **Arithmetic Operators**
   - Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations.
   - Common operators include:
     - `+` for addition
     - `-` for subtraction
     - `*` for multiplication
     - `/` for division
     - `%` for modulus (remainder)

---

## 17. **Binary Operators**
   - Binary operators work on two operands and include arithmetic, relational, and logical operators.
   - Example: 
     - `a + b` adds two operands.
     - `a && b` checks if both operands are true.

---

## 18. **Relational and Logical Operators**
   - **Relational operators** compare two values (e.g., `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`).
   - **Logical operators** evaluate logical conditions (e.g., `&&` for AND, `||` for OR, `!` for NOT).
   - They are used in decision-making and controlling the flow of programs.

---

## 19. **The “if” Statement**
   - The `if` statement allows the execution of code only if a specific condition is true.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     if (a > b) {
         cout << "a is greater than b";
     }
     ```

---

## 20. **The “if-else” Statement**
   - The `if-else` statement provides an alternative action if the condition is false.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     if (a > b) {
         cout << "a is greater";
     } else {
         cout << "b is greater";
     }
     ```

---

## 21. **Nested “if” Statements**
   - Nested `if` statements are used when there are multiple conditions to check within an `if` block.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     if (a > b) {
         if (b > c) {
             cout << "b is the smallest";
         }
     }
     ```

---

## 22. **The “else-if” Ladder Statement**
   - The `else-if` ladder is used to check multiple conditions sequentially.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     if (a > b) {
         cout << "a is greater";
     } else if (a == b) {
         cout << "a is equal to b";
     } else {
         cout << "b is greater";
     }
     ```

---

## 23. **The “for” Loop**
   - A `for` loop repeats a block of code a specific number of times.
   - Syntax:
     ```cpp
     for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
         cout << i << " ";
     }
     ```

---

## 24. **The Nested “for” Loop**
   - A nested `for` loop involves placing one `for` loop inside another.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
         for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
             cout << i << " " << j << endl;
         }
     }
     ```

---

## 25. **The “while” Loop**
   - The `while` loop repeats a block of code as long as the condition is true.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     int i = 0;
     while (i < 5) {
         cout << i << " ";
         i++;
     }
     ```

---

## 26. **The Nested “while” Loop**
   - A nested `while` loop uses one `while` loop inside another.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     int i = 0;
     while (i < 3) {
         int j = 0;
         while (j < 3) {
             cout << i << " " << j << endl;
             j++;
         }
         i++;
     }
     ```

---

## 27. **The “do-while” Loop**
   - The `do-while` loop executes the code block at least once before checking the condition.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     int i = 0;
     do {
         cout << i << " ";
         i++;
     } while (i < 5);
     ```

---

## 28. **The Nested “do-while” Loop**
   - A nested `do-while` loop places one `do-while` loop inside another.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     int i = 0;
     do {
         int j = 0;
         do {
             cout << i << " " << j << endl;
             j++;
         } while (j < 3);
         i++;
     } while (i < 3);
     ```

---

## 29. **The “break” and “continue” Statements**
   - The `break` statement exits a loop immediately.
   - The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
         if (i == 3) break; // Exits the loop when i equals 3
         cout << i << " ";
     }
     ```

---

## 30. **The “switch-case” Statement**
   - The `switch-case` statement allows testing a variable against a list of possible values.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     int day = 2;
     switch (day) {
         case 1: cout << "Monday"; break;
         case 2: cout << "Tuesday"; break;
         default: cout << "Invalid day";
     }
     ```

   - It involves defining the structure of data, relationships between data, and constraints.
   - Common models include hierarchical, network, and relational models.

---

## 5. **Relational Data Modelling**
   - Relational data modeling structures data into tables (relations) where each table consists of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).
   - It uses primary keys to uniquely identify records and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.
   - This model is based on the concept of set theory and ensures data integrity.

---

## 6. **Normalization**
   - Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency.
   - The goal is to divide large tables into smaller, related tables to minimize the risk of data anomalies.
   - It involves applying normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to achieve a more efficient structure.

---

## 7. **Transaction**
   - A transaction is a sequence of operations that are treated as a single unit of work.
   - Transactions ensure data consistency and integrity, and they are managed using properties known as ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).
   - A transaction is either fully completed (committed) or fully undone (rolled back).

---

## 8. **Types of Keys**
   - **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for a record in a table, ensuring no two rows have the same value for this key.
   - **Foreign Key**: A key that links two tables, referencing the primary key of another table.
   - **Candidate Key**: Any key that could uniquely identify a record (a potential primary key).
   - **Composite Key**: A key made up of multiple columns to uniquely identify a record.

---

## 9. **Introduction to SQL**
   - SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.
   - It includes commands for querying data, inserting, updating, and deleting records, and defining the database schema.
   - SQL is essential for interacting with databases and is supported by most RDBMS.

   - **IN, BETWEEN, LIKE**: Used for checking a value within a range or a set.

---

## 13. **SQL Table**
   - A table is a collection of rows and columns used to store data.
   - Each column in a table represents a data attribute, and each row represents a record.
   - Tables are created using the `CREATE TABLE` statement and can be modified using `ALTER TABLE`.

---

## 14. **Select Statement**
   - The `SELECT` statement is used to query and retrieve data from one or more tables.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM Employees;
     ```
   - You can specify columns, apply conditions, and order the results using `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and other clauses.

---

## 15. **Insert Statement**
   - The `INSERT` statement is used to add new records to a table.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO Employees (name, age, department)
     VALUES ('John Doe', 30, 'HR');
     ```

---

## 16. **Update Statement**
   - The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing records in a table.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     UPDATE Employees
     SET age = 31
     WHERE name = 'John Doe';
     ```

---

## 17. **Delete Statement**
   - The `DELETE` statement is used to remove records from a table.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM Employees
     WHERE name = 'John Doe';
     ```

---

## 18. **Views**
   - A view is a virtual table created by querying one or more tables.
   - It simplifies complex queries and provides a layer of abstraction.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE VIEW Employee_View AS
     SELECT name, department FROM Employees WHERE age > 25;
     ```

---

## 19. **Sub Queries**
   - A subquery is a query nested inside another query.
   - It is used to retrieve data that will be used by the outer query.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT name FROM Employees
     WHERE age = (SELECT MAX(age) FROM Employees);
     ```

---

## 20. **Aggregate Function**
   - Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single result.
   - Common aggregate functions include `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, and `MAX()`.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT AVG(age) FROM Employees;
     ```

---

## 21. **SQL Joins**

Introduction to Web Applications 


-----------

## 1. **Client Server Architecture**
   - Client-server architecture is a network structure where one computer (the client) requests services and resources from another computer (the server).
   - The client sends requests over a network, and the server processes the request and returns the appropriate data or service.
   - This architecture helps in separating the user interface (client-side) from data processing and storage (server-side), improving scalability and maintainability.

---

## 2. **Web Applications**
   - Web applications are programs or applications that run on a web server rather than being installed on the client’s machine.
   - They are accessed through a web browser, allowing users to interact with the application using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
   - Examples of web applications include Gmail, online banking, and social media platforms.

---

## 3. **Flow of Control in a Web Application**
   - The flow begins when a user interacts with a web browser and sends a request to the web server.
   - The server processes the request, which may involve querying a database, executing server-side code, or interacting with APIs.
   - After processing, the server sends the response (often an HTML page) back to the browser, which then renders the content for the user to view.

---

## 4. **Browser as a Thin Client and Web Server**
   - A **thin client** is a lightweight client that relies on a web server to perform most of the processing tasks, sending only user input and receiving results.
   - The **web server** processes client requests (e.g., for web pages) and communicates with backend systems, databases, and application servers to deliver the content to the client.
   - The browser, in this case, serves as the thin client, focusing on rendering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while relying on the server for functionality.

---

## 5. **Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
   - **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**: The standard markup language used to create the structure of web pages (headings, paragraphs, images, links).
   - **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**: Used for styling HTML elements, including layout, colors, fonts, and positioning.
   - **JavaScript**: A programming language used to make web pages interactive by manipulating HTML elements, handling user events, and communicating with servers.

---

## 6. **Benefits of Web Applications**
   - **Accessibility**: Web applications can be accessed from any device with a web browser and an internet connection.
   - **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Web apps are platform-independent and work on various operating systems, like Windows, macOS, and Linux.
   - **Centralized Data**: Data is stored on the server, allowing real-time updates, backups, and easier maintenance.

---

## 7. **Static Pages and Dynamic Pages**
   - **Static Pages**: Web pages with fixed content, where the content does not change unless manually updated. They are typically faster to load but not interactive.
   - **Dynamic Pages**: Web pages where the content can change based on user interaction or other factors. These pages are generated by the server on request, often using databases or user input.

---

## 8. **Application Servers**
   - An application server is a software framework that provides services such as web page generation, database connectivity, and transaction management.
   - It processes business logic and communicates with web servers to deliver dynamic content to users.
   - Popular application servers include Apache Tomcat, JBoss, and WebLogic.

---

## 9. **N-Tier Architecture**
   - N-Tier architecture (also known as multi-tier architecture) separates an application into multiple layers or "tiers," such as:
     - **Presentation Layer**: The user interface, typically a web browser or client application.
     - **Application Layer**: Contains the business logic or processing.
     - **Data Layer**: Manages data storage, usually involving databases.
   - This separation improves scalability, maintainability, and flexibility by decoupling various components.

---

## 10. **Difference Between Web Server and Application Server**
   - **Web Server**: A web server handles HTTP requests from clients (browsers) and serves static content like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. It may also forward requests to an application server.
   - **Application Server**: An application server is responsible for running the business logic of a web application, processing dynamic requests (e.g., querying databases), and generating dynamic content. It often works with a web server to provide full application functionality.
   - **Key Difference**: While a web server serves static content and handles HTTP requests, an application server runs the application’s backend code, providing dynamic functionality.

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING:


---

## 1. **STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)**

The Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is a series of phases that define the testing process in software development. It ensures the software is tested thoroughly to meet the desired quality standards.

### Phases of STLC:
1. **Requirement Analysis**: 
   - The testing team analyzes the requirements from the testing perspective. This involves understanding the functional and non-functional requirements of the software to plan the testing approach.

2. **Test Planning**: 
   - Test planning involves defining the scope, objectives, resources, and schedule for the testing process. The team creates a detailed test plan that includes the testing strategy, test environment, tools, and roles involved in the process.

3. **Test Design**: 
   - During this phase, test cases, test scripts, and other test documentation are designed based on the requirements and design specifications. This helps in creating reusable and comprehensive tests for the software.

4. **Test Environment Setup**: 
   - The test environment, including hardware, software, network configurations, and necessary tools, is set up to execute the tests. This environment should simulate the production environment to ensure accuracy.

5. **Test Execution**: 
   - The test cases are executed, and the results are logged. The testing team identifies defects or discrepancies between the actual and expected results.

6. **Defect Reporting**: 
   - Any defects found during the testing process are documented and reported to the development team. Defects are tracked using tools like Jira or Bugzilla.

7. **Test Closure**: 
   - Once the tests are complete, the testing team prepares test summary reports, evaluates the testing process, and closes the testing phase. The team analyzes whether the testing objectives have been met.

### Key Objectives of STLC:
- To ensure comprehensive testing of the software.
- To identify defects early in the development cycle.
- To deliver high-quality software that meets user expectations.

---

## 2. **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)**

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic approach used for developing software applications, consisting of various stages to ensure a high-quality software product.

### Phases of SDLC:
1. **Requirement Gathering and Analysis**: 
   - The first phase focuses on collecting business requirements from stakeholders and analyzing them to define the software's functionality and scope. This is a critical phase to avoid misunderstandings and ensure clarity.

2. **System Design**: 
   - Based on the requirements, the system’s architecture is designed. This includes defining the system’s components, technologies, databases, user interfaces, and other specifications. The design phase can be further divided into high-level design and low-level design.

3. **Implementation (Coding)**: 
   - In this phase, the software is developed based on the design documents. Developers write code, following the design specifications and using the appropriate programming languages and tools.

4. **Testing**: 
   - After coding, the software undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix any defects. This phase ensures that the software works as intended and meets user requirements. Testing types can include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

5. **Deployment**: 
   - After successful testing, the software is deployed to the production environment for end-users. This phase involves data migration, setup, and final configuration.

6. **Maintenance**: 
   - Once the software is deployed, it enters the maintenance phase. This involves fixing any post-deployment issues, updating the software to adapt to changes, and ensuring it continues to perform well over time.

### SDLC Models:
There are various SDLC models (Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, etc.), each suited for different project types. The model chosen affects the flow and interaction of these phases.

---

## 3. **Waterfall Model**

The Waterfall Model is one of the earliest SDLC models, known for its linear and sequential approach. It is a "plan-driven" model where each phase must be completed before the next phase begins. 

### Phases of the Waterfall Model:
1. **Requirement Analysis**: 
   - All system requirements are gathered and documented in detail. This phase emphasizes complete documentation and clear understanding of the project.

2. **System Design**: 
   - Based on the gathered requirements, system and software architecture is designed. The high-level design (HLD) and low-level design (LLD) are created.

3. **Implementation**: 
   - Developers start coding the software based on the design documentation. This is the actual development phase.

4. **Integration and Testing (Verification)**: 
   - After coding, the software is integrated, and testing begins. This phase is crucial to identify defects and ensure the software functions as per the requirements.

5. **Deployment**: 
   - Once the software passes the testing phase, it is deployed to the end-users. Any post-deployment issues are handled during this phase.

6. **Maintenance**: 
   - After deployment, the system enters the maintenance phase where updates, bug fixes, and improvements are made.

### Advantages of Waterfall Model:
- Simple and easy to understand.
- Clear documentation and well-defined stages.
- Best suited for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change.

### Disadvantages of Waterfall Model:
- Rigid structure, making it hard to accommodate changes after a phase is completed.
- Late testing phase, which may result in higher costs for fixing defects.
- Limited customer feedback during the development process.

---

## 4. **Agile Model**

The Agile Model is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. Unlike the Waterfall model, Agile focuses on delivering small, functional pieces of software frequently and incorporating customer feedback throughout the development cycle.

### Key Concepts of Agile:
1. **Iterative Development**: 
   - The development process is broken into smaller iterations, called sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks. Each sprint results in a working increment of the software that adds value to the product.

2. **Customer Collaboration**: 
   - Continuous communication with the customer or stakeholder ensures that the software aligns with their needs and requirements. Changes can be incorporated at any stage of development.

3. **Cross-functional Teams**: 
   - Agile promotes collaboration among self-organizing, cross-functional teams that include developers, testers, designers, and business stakeholders.

4. **Deliver Working Software Frequently**: 
   - Agile encourages delivering a working version of the software regularly (at the end of each sprint) to gather feedback and make improvements.

### Agile Methodologies:
- **Scrum**: A framework that organizes development into sprints with specific roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team).
- **Kanban**: A visual method for managing work, focusing on continuous delivery and workflow efficiency.
- **Extreme Programming (XP)**: Focuses on engineering practices, like pair programming and test-driven development (TDD), to ensure high-quality code.

### Advantages of Agile:
- Highly flexible and adaptable to changing requirements.
- Faster delivery of functional software.
- Enhanced collaboration between team members and stakeholders.

### Disadvantages of Agile:
- Can be challenging to manage scope creep if requirements are not well defined.
- Requires significant customer involvement.
- May be difficult to scale for large projects with complex requirements.

  INTRODUCTION TO OOPS USING C++
-----
---

## **1. Maintainable Programs**
   - Maintainable programs are those that can be easily understood, modified, and extended over time. 
   - Good practices in coding, such as modularization, proper naming conventions, and code documentation, contribute to maintainability.
   - Code reviews and testing practices also help maintain the quality of code as it evolves.

---

## **2. Structured Programming – Advantages and Disadvantages**

### **Advantages**:
   - Easier to understand and implement because of its linear flow.
   - Easier to debug and maintain due to simpler code structures.
   - Encourages the use of functions to divide tasks into smaller, manageable sections.

### **Disadvantages**:
   - Not well-suited for complex or large-scale programs.
   - Lacks features like inheritance, polymorphism, etc., which may lead to redundancy in code.
   - Can result in tightly coupled code when the program grows in size.

---

## **3. Object-Oriented Programming**

   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on objects and classes.
   - It enables data abstraction, encapsulation, and code reuse.
   - OOP allows for easier maintenance, scalability, and flexibility of software applications.

---

## **4. What is OOPS?**
   - **OOPS** stands for **Object-Oriented Programming System**, which focuses on objects and data rather than actions and logic.
   - It is based on key principles such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
   - Objects represent real-world entities, and classes define the properties and behaviors of these objects.

---

## **5. Classes and Objects**

### **Classes**:
   - A class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining the properties (data members) and behaviors (methods/functions) an object can have.
   
### **Objects**:
   - Objects are instances of classes. They contain actual values for the properties and can call the methods defined in the class.

---

## **6. Advantages of OOPS – Introduction to Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance**

### **Abstraction**:
   - Hides complex implementation details and shows only the essential features of an object.  
   - Example: A car's steering wheel provides an abstraction of controlling the car without needing to understand its internal mechanics.

### **Encapsulation**:
   - Bundles the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) into a single unit, restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
   
### **Polymorphism**:
   - Allows one function, operator, or object to behave differently based on the context.  
   - Example: A function named `draw()` can be implemented for different shapes (circle, square) in different ways.

### **Inheritance**:
   - Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, promoting code reusability.
   
---

## **7. OOPS Designs with Real-time Examples**

   - **Real-Time Example 1**: A **Bank Account** class can be inherited by specialized classes like **SavingsAccount** and **CurrentAccount** to add specific behaviors.
   - **Real-Time Example 2**: In a **Library System**, the base class `Book` can be inherited by classes `FictionBook` and `NonFictionBook`, with additional functionalities unique to each.

---

## **8. Creating Classes with Data Members and Functions in C++**
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Student {
     public:
         string name;
         int age;

         void display() {
             cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << endl;
         }
     };
     ```

---

## **9. Creating Objects in C++**
   - Objects can be created by declaring them using the class name.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     Student s1;
     s1.name = "John";
     s1.age = 21;
     s1.display();
     ```

---

## **10. Access Specifiers – Private and Public**

### **Private**:
   - Members declared as private can only be accessed by functions within the same class.
   
### **Public**:
   - Members declared as public can be accessed from any function or object.

---

## **11. Function Overloading**
   - Function overloading allows multiple functions to have the same name but different parameter types or numbers.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Example {
     public:
         void show(int i) { cout << "Integer: " << i << endl; }
         void show(double d) { cout << "Double: " << d << endl; }
     };
     ```

---

## **12. Initializing an Object Using Constructor**
   - A **constructor** is a special function that initializes an object when it is created.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Student {
     public:
         string name;
         int age;
         
         Student(string n, int a) { name = n; age = a; }
     };
     ```

---

## **13. Default and Parameterized Constructors**
   - **Default Constructor**: Initializes objects with default values.  
     - Example: `Student() { name = "Unknown"; age = 0; }`
   - **Parameterized Constructor**: Initializes objects with user-specified values.  
     - Example: `Student(string n, int a) { name = n; age = a; }`

---

## **14. The Copy Constructor**
   - A **copy constructor** creates a new object as a copy of an existing object.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     Student(const Student& other) { name = other.name; age = other.age; }
     ```

---

## **15. Destructors**
   - A **destructor** is called when an object goes out of scope to clean up resources.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     ~Student() { cout << "Destructor called for " << name << endl; }
     ```

---

## **16. Static Data Members and Static Functions**

### **Static Data Members**:
   - Static members are shared by all instances of a class.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Student {
     public:
         static int count;
     };
     ```

### **Static Functions**:
   - Static functions can be called without creating an object of the class.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Student {
     public:
         static void display() { cout << "Static function" << endl; }
     };
     ```

---

## **17. The Const Data Members**
   - `const` data members cannot be modified after initialization.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Student {
     public:
         const int id;
         Student(int id) : id(id) { }
     };
     ```

---

## **18. The Friend Functions**
   - A **friend function** is a function outside the class but has access to the private and protected members.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Box {
     private:
         int length;
     public:
         Box(int len) : length(len) {}
         friend void printLength(Box b);
     };
     ```

---

## **19. The Friend Classes**
   - A **friend class** can access private and protected members of another class.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class A {
     private:
         int x;
     public:
         A(int val) : x(val) {}
         friend class B;
     };
     
     class B {
     public:
         void show(A a) { cout << a.x << endl; }
     };
     ```

---

## **20. Array as Data Member of a Class**
   - Arrays can be used as data members within a class to store multiple values.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Student {
     public:
         int marks[5];
     };
     ```

---

## **21. Array of Objects**
   - You can create an array of objects where each object can have its own set of data members.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     Student students[10];
     ```

---

## **22. Pointer as the Data Member of a Class**
   - A class can have pointers as data members to dynamically allocate memory.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Student {
     public:
         int *marks;
         Student() { marks = new int[5]; }
         ~Student() { delete[] marks; }
     };
     ```

---

## **23. Pointer to an Object**
   - A pointer can hold the address of an object, allowing dynamic access to the object’s data and functions.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     Student* s1 = new Student();
     s1->display();
     ```

---

## **24. The “This” Pointer**
   - The **this** pointer refers to the current instance of the class.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Student {
     public:
         string name;
         void setName(string name) { this->name = name; }
     };
     ```

---

## **25. An Object as the Data Member of a Class**
   - A class can have objects of other classes as its data members.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Address {
     public:
         string city;
     };

     class Student {
     public:
         Address addr;
     };
     ```

---

## **26. Aggregation and “Has-a” Relationship**
   - **Aggregation** is a special type of association where one class has objects of other classes as members.  
   - **Example**: A **Library** has a **Book** (has-a relationship).

---

## **27. Dynamic Memory Allocation**
   - Dynamic memory allocation uses pointers and `new`/`delete` operators to allocate memory during runtime.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     int* ptr = new int; // Dynamically allocated memory
     delete ptr; // Free memory
     ```

---

## **28. Creating and Destroying Objects Dynamically**
   - Objects can be created and destroyed at runtime using `new` and `delete`.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     Student* s1 = new Student(); // Create object dynamically
     delete s1; // Destroy object
     ```

---

INHERITANCE:

---

## **1. Inheritance and Its Advantages**

### **Inheritance**:
   - **Inheritance** is an OOP concept that allows one class (child class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (parent class).
   - It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between parent and child classes.

### **Advantages**:
   - **Reusability**: Inherited properties and methods can be reused in the child class without redefining them.
   - **Extensibility**: New functionality can be added to existing code by extending classes.
   - **Improved maintenance**: Inheritance allows easier maintenance of code since modifications in the parent class can automatically be reflected in the child classes.

---

## **2. The Protected Access**
   - The **protected** access modifier allows the members (variables, methods) to be accessible within the class and its derived (child) classes but not from outside.
   - It strikes a balance between **private** and **public** access, restricting outside access while allowing derived classes to access the protected members.

---

## **3. Calling Superclass Methods**
   - You can call superclass methods from the subclass using the `super` keyword in languages that support it (e.g., Java).
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Animal {
     public:
         void sound() { cout << "Some sound"; }
     };

     class Dog : public Animal {
     public:
         void sound() { 
             Animal::sound(); // Calling superclass method
             cout << " Woof"; 
         }
     };
     ```

---

## **4. Constructors in Inheritance**
   - When a derived class object is created, the constructor of the base class is called first before the derived class constructor.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Base {
     public:
         Base() { cout << "Base Constructor" << endl; }
     };

     class Derived : public Base {
     public:
         Derived() { cout << "Derived Constructor" << endl; }
     };
     ```

---

## **5. Method Overriding**
   - **Method overriding** occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the superclass.
   - The method in the subclass must have the same signature as in the parent class.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Base {
     public:
         virtual void display() { cout << "Base Display" << endl; }
     };

     class Derived : public Base {
     public:
         void display() override { cout << "Derived Display" << endl; }
     };
     ```

---

## **6. Pointer to a Base Class**
   - A **pointer to a base class** can be used to store the address of an object of any derived class.
   - This allows for polymorphic behavior and dynamic binding.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Base {
     public:
         virtual void display() { cout << "Base" << endl; }
     };

     class Derived : public Base {
     public:
         void display() { cout << "Derived" << endl; }
     };

     Base* ptr = new Derived();
     ptr->display(); // Output: Derived
     ```

---

## **7. Virtual Functions**
   - **Virtual functions** are functions defined in a base class that can be overridden in derived classes.
   - They ensure that the correct function is called for an object, regardless of the type of reference (or pointer) used for the function call.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Base {
     public:
         virtual void display() { cout << "Base Display" << endl; }
     };

     class Derived : public Base {
     public:
         void display() override { cout << "Derived Display" << endl; }
     };

     Base* b = new Derived();
     b->display(); // Output: Derived Display
     ```

---

## **8. Dynamic/Runtime Binding and Polymorphism**
   - **Runtime Binding** (also known as **Dynamic Binding**) refers to the process of linking a function call to its definition at runtime, rather than compile time.
   - **Polymorphism** is the ability of different objects to respond to the same function call in different ways, typically using method overriding and dynamic binding.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Base {
     public:
         virtual void display() { cout << "Base Display" << endl; }
     };

     class Derived : public Base {
     public:
         void display() override { cout << "Derived Display" << endl; }
     };

     Base* ptr = new Derived();
     ptr->display(); // Output: Derived Display
     ```

---

## **9. Casting a Class**
   - **Casting** in C++ refers to the process of converting an object of one class type into another class type.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Base {
     public:
         virtual void display() { cout << "Base Display" << endl; }
     };

     class Derived : public Base {
     public:
         void display() override { cout << "Derived Display" << endl; }
     };

     Base* b = new Derived();
     Derived* d = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(b); // Cast to derived class
     d->display(); // Output: Derived Display
     ```

---

## **10. Single Inheritance**
   - **Single Inheritance** occurs when a class is derived from a single base class.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Animal {
     public:
         void speak() { cout << "Animal speaks"; }
     };

     class Dog : public Animal {
     public:
         void speak() { cout << "Dog barks"; }
     };
     ```

---

## **11. Multilevel Inheritance**
   - **Multilevel Inheritance** occurs when a class is derived from a derived class, forming a chain of inheritance.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Animal {
     public:
         void speak() { cout << "Animal speaks"; }
     };

     class Dog : public Animal {
     public:
         void speak() { cout << "Dog barks"; }
     };

     class Puppy : public Dog {
     public:
         void speak() { cout << "Puppy yelps"; }
     };
     ```

---

## **12. Multiple Inheritance**
   - **Multiple Inheritance** occurs when a class is derived from more than one base class.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Animal {
     public:
         void speak() { cout << "Animal speaks"; }
     };

     class Bird {
     public:
         void fly() { cout << "Bird flies"; }
     };

     class Bat : public Animal, public Bird {
     public:
         void fly() { cout << "Bat flies"; }
     };
     ```

---

## **13. Hierarchical Inheritance**
   - **Hierarchical Inheritance** occurs when multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Animal {
     public:
         void speak() { cout << "Animal speaks"; }
     };

     class Dog : public Animal {
     public:
         void speak() { cout << "Dog barks"; }
     };

     class Cat : public Animal {
     public:
         void speak() { cout << "Cat meows"; }
     };
     ```

---

## **14. Hybrid Inheritance**
   - **Hybrid Inheritance** occurs when a class inherits from more than one class, resulting in a combination of two or more types of inheritance (e.g., multiple and multilevel inheritance).
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     class Animal {
     public:
         void speak() { cout << "Animal speaks"; }
     };

     class Bird {
     public:
         void fly() { cout << "Bird flies"; }
     };

     class Bat : public Animal, public Bird {
     public:
         void speak() { cout << "Bat speaks"; }
     };
     ```

---

## **15. Difference Between “Is-a” and “Has-a” Relationship**

### **"Is-a" Relationship**:
   - Refers to a relationship where a subclass is a type of the parent class.
   - **Example**: A **Dog** "is-a" **Animal** (inheritance relationship).

### **"Has-a" Relationship**:
   - Refers to a relationship where a class contains objects of another class as members.
   - **Example**: A **Library** "has-a" **Book** (composition or aggregation relationship).

POLYMORPHISM:
-------
---

## **1. Polymorphism and Its Advantages**

### **Polymorphism**:
   - Polymorphism is an OOP concept that allows a single interface to represent different data types or methods.
   - It enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class.

### **Advantages**:
   - **Flexibility**: Makes code more flexible and easier to maintain by allowing methods to perform different tasks based on the object.
   - **Reusability**: Promotes code reuse by allowing the same interface for different data types or methods.
   - **Extensibility**: Simplifies extending the functionality of an application by introducing new classes or methods.

---

## **2. Types of Polymorphism**

1. **Compile-time Polymorphism**:
   - Achieved using **method overloading** and **operator overloading**.
   - The method to be called is determined at compile time.

2. **Run-time Polymorphism**:
   - Achieved using **method overriding** and **virtual functions**.
   - The method to be called is determined at runtime through dynamic binding.

---

## **3. Types of Binding**

1. **Static Binding (Early Binding)**:
   - Method or function call is resolved at compile time.
   - Used in compile-time polymorphism.
   - **Example**: Function Overloading.

2. **Dynamic Binding (Late Binding)**:
   - Method or function call is resolved at runtime.
   - Used in runtime polymorphism.
   - **Example**: Virtual Functions in C++.

---

## **4. Method Overloading and Its Uses**

### **Method Overloading**:
   - A feature of OOP that allows a class to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.
   - The compiler determines which method to call based on the number or type of arguments.

### **Uses**:
   - Improves code readability by grouping similar functionality under the same method name.
   - Simplifies development by avoiding unnecessary method names for similar operations.
   - Enhances flexibility by allowing methods to handle different types of input.

---

## **5. Conditions of Overloading**

1. The function name must be the same, but the parameter list must differ:
   - **Number of parameters**.
   - **Type of parameters**.
   - **Order of parameters**.
2. Return type is not considered for overloading.
3. Overloading can be done within the same class or between a base and a derived class.

---

## **6. Method Overriding**

### **Method Overriding**:
   - Allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method already defined in the superclass.
   - The method in the child class must have the same name, return type, and parameters as in the parent class.

### **Key Features**:
   - Achieves runtime polymorphism.
   - Requires the base class method to be declared as `virtual` in C++.

---

## **7. Scenario of Overriding**

- **When to use Overriding**:
  - To modify or enhance the functionality of a method in a parent class.
  - When behavior specific to the subclass is needed.
  - For implementing runtime polymorphism in OOP programs.

- **Example**:
  ```cpp
  class Animal {
  public:
      virtual void speak() { cout << "Animal speaks" << endl; }
  };

  class Dog : public Animal {
  public:
      void speak() override { cout << "Dog barks" << endl; }
  };

  Animal* a = new Dog();
  a->speak(); // Output: Dog barks
  ```

---

## **8. Difference Between Overloading and Overriding**

| **Aspect**            | **Overloading**                               | **Overriding**                           |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------    |------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**        | Same method name with different parameters.  | Same method name and signature in child class. |
| **Binding**           | Static Binding (Compile-time).               | Dynamic Binding (Runtime).               |
| **Inheritance**       | Not required.                                | Requires inheritance.                    |
| **Return Type**       | Can differ.                                  | Must be the same as the base class.      |
| **Use Case**          | Used for compile-time polymorphism.          | Used for runtime polymorphism.           |
| **Example**           | Function Overloading.                        | Virtual Functions.                       |

---

---

## **1. Virtual Functions**

### **Virtual Functions**:
   - A **virtual function** in C++ is a member function in a base class that can be overridden in a derived class.
   - It is declared using the `virtual` keyword in the base class.
   - Provides runtime polymorphism, allowing the correct function to be called for an object, regardless of its reference type.

### **Key Features**:
   - Declared in the base class with the `virtual` keyword.
   - Resolves function calls dynamically at runtime (dynamic binding).
   - Requires a base class pointer or reference to call derived class methods.

### **Example**:
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() { cout << "Base class" << endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override { cout << "Derived class" << endl; }
};

Base* obj = new Derived();
obj->show();  // Output: Derived class
```

---

## **2. Pure Virtual Functions**

### **Pure Virtual Functions**:
   - A **pure virtual function** is a virtual function with no implementation in the base class.
   - Declared by assigning `= 0` to the virtual function in the base class.
   - Any class with at least one pure virtual function is considered an **abstract class**.

### **Key Features**:
   - Forces derived classes to provide their implementation for the pure virtual function.
   - Used to create a common interface for all derived classes.

### **Example**:
```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0;  // Pure virtual function
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override { cout << "Drawing Circle" << endl; }
};

Shape* shape = new Circle();
shape->draw();  // Output: Drawing Circle
```

---

## **3. Abstract Class**

### **Abstract Class**:
   - A class that cannot be instantiated and serves as a blueprint for derived classes.
   - Contains at least one pure virtual function.
   - Can have both implemented and non-implemented (pure virtual) member functions.

### **Advantages**:
   - Promotes code reuse by providing a base for multiple derived classes.
   - Defines a consistent interface for a family of classes.

### **Key Features**:
   - Cannot create an object of an abstract class directly.
   - Derived classes must implement all pure virtual functions to be instantiated.

### **Example**:
```cpp
class Vehicle {
public:
    virtual void move() = 0;  // Pure virtual function
    void fuel() { cout << "Filling fuel" << endl; }
};

class Car : public Vehicle {
public:
    void move() override { cout << "Car is moving" << endl; }
};

Vehicle* vehicle = new Car();
vehicle->move();  // Output: Car is moving
vehicle->fuel();  // Output: Filling fuel
```

EXCEPTION HANDLING:
---

## **1. Exceptions**

### **Definition**:
   - Exceptions are runtime errors that disrupt the normal flow of a program.
   - Examples include divide-by-zero errors, invalid memory access, and file I/O issues.

### **Key Features**:
   - Provides a mechanism to handle errors gracefully.
   - Prevents abrupt program termination by transferring control to exception handlers.

---

## **2. Handling Exceptions Using `try-catch`**

### **Explanation**:
   - The `try` block contains the code that might throw an exception.
   - The `catch` block handles the exception.

### **Syntax**:
```cpp
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // Handle the exception
}
```

### **Example**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    try {
        int a = 5, b = 0;
        if (b == 0)
            throw "Division by zero error!";
        cout << a / b << endl;
    } catch (const char* msg) {
        cout << "Exception: " << msg << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:  
`Exception: Division by zero error!`

---

## **3. Multiple Catch Blocks**

### **Explanation**:
   - A `try` block can have multiple `catch` blocks to handle different types of exceptions.

### **Example**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    try {
        int num = 1;
        if (num == 1)
            throw 10;
        else if (num == 2)
            throw "An error occurred!";
    } catch (int e) {
        cout << "Integer Exception: " << e << endl;
    } catch (const char* msg) {
        cout << "String Exception: " << msg << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:  
`Integer Exception: 10`

---

## **4. The `catch` Block to Catch All Exceptions**

### **Explanation**:
   - The `catch(...)` block can be used to catch any type of exception.

### **Example**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    try {
        throw 3.14;
    } catch (...) {
        cout << "An exception occurred!" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:  
`An exception occurred!`

---

## **5. Custom Exception**

### **Explanation**:
   - Users can define their own exception classes to handle specific errors.

### **Example**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class CustomException : public exception {
    string message;

public:
    CustomException(string msg) : message(msg) {}
    const char* what() const noexcept override { return message.c_str(); }
};

int main() {
    try {
        throw CustomException("Custom error occurred!");
    } catch (CustomException& e) {
        cout << "Exception: " << e.what() << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:  
`Exception: Custom error occurred!`

---

## **6. Throwing an Exception**

### **Explanation**:
   - Exceptions are thrown using the `throw` keyword.
   - Can throw built-in types (e.g., `int`, `double`) or user-defined types.

### **Example**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void divide(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0)
        throw "Division by zero error!";
    cout << "Result: " << a / b << endl;
}

int main() {
    try {
        divide(10, 0);
    } catch (const char* msg) {
        cout << "Exception: " << msg << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Output**:  
`Exception: Division by zero error!`

OPERATOR OVERLOADING:
---
---

## **1. Introduction to Operator Overloading**

### **Definition**:
   - Operator overloading in C++ allows developers to redefine the way operators work for user-defined types.
   - It enhances code readability and enables intuitive interaction with objects.

### **Key Points**:
   - Operators such as `+`, `-`, `=`, and `<<` can be overloaded.
   - Overloaded operators must have at least one user-defined type as an operand.
   - Does not change operator precedence or associativity.

### **Example**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Complex {
    int real, imag;

public:
    Complex(int r, int i) : real(r), imag(i) {}
    Complex operator+(const Complex& c) {
        return Complex(real + c.real, imag + c.imag);
    }
    void display() { cout << real << " + " << imag << "i" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Complex c1(3, 4), c2(1, 2);
    Complex c3 = c1 + c2;  // Operator Overloading
    c3.display();          // Output: 4 + 6i
    return 0;
}
```

---

## **2. Overloading the Assignment Operator**

### **Definition**:
   - Overloading the `=` operator allows copying object properties from one object to another with custom logic.

### **Example**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

class String {
    char* str;

public:
    String(const char* s) {
        str = new char[strlen(s) + 1];
        strcpy(str, s);
    }
    String& operator=(const String& s) {
        if (this == &s) return *this;  // Self-assignment check
        delete[] str;
        str = new char[strlen(s.str) + 1];
        strcpy(str, s.str);
        return *this;
    }
    void display() { cout << str << endl; }
};

int main() {
    String s1("Hello"), s2("World");
    s1 = s2;
    s1.display();  // Output: World
    return 0;
}
```

---

## **3. Overloading Operators as Member Functions**

### **Explanation**:
   - Member functions can overload operators that operate on the current object and another operand.

### **Example**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Counter {
    int count;

public:
    Counter(int c = 0) : count(c) {}
    Counter operator++() {  // Prefix increment
        ++count;
        return *this;
    }
    void display() { cout << count << endl; }
};

int main() {
    Counter c(5);
    ++c;
    c.display();  // Output: 6
    return 0;
}
```

---

## **4. Overloading Operators as Global Functions**

### **Explanation**:
   - Global functions can overload operators by accessing private members using friend functions.

### **Example**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Complex {
    int real, imag;

public:
    Complex(int r = 0, int i = 0) : real(r), imag(i) {}
    friend Complex operator+(const Complex& c1, const Complex& c2);
    void display() { cout << real << " + " << imag << "i" << endl; }
};

Complex operator+(const Complex& c1, const Complex& c2) {
    return Complex(c1.real + c2.real, c1.imag + c2.imag);
}

int main() {
    Complex c1(3, 4), c2(1, 2);
    Complex c3 = c1 + c2;  // Global Operator Overloading
    c3.display();          // Output: 4 + 6i
    return 0;
}
```

---

## **5. Overloading the Stream Insertion and Extraction Operators**

### **Explanation**:
   - The `<<` and `>>` operators are commonly overloaded for easy input and output of user-defined types.
   - These operators must be overloaded as global functions with friend access.

### **Example**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Complex {
    int real, imag;

public:
    Complex(int r = 0, int i = 0) : real(r), imag(i) {}
    friend ostream& operator<<(ostream& out, const Complex& c);
    friend istream& operator>>(istream& in, Complex& c);
};

ostream& operator<<(ostream& out, const Complex& c) {
    out << c.real << " + " << c.imag << "i";
    return out;
}

istream& operator>>(istream& in, Complex& c) {
    cout << "Enter real and imaginary parts: ";
    in >> c.real >> c.imag;
    return in;
}

int main() {
    Complex c;
    cin >> c;           // Input: 3 4
    cout << c << endl;  // Output: 3 + 4i
    return 0;
}

```
STANDARD LIBRARY TEMPLATES:
---

## **1. Overview of Templates**

### **Definition**:
   - Templates in C++ allow writing generic and reusable code for functions and classes.
   - They enable operations to work with any data type without rewriting the entire code.

### **Key Points**:
   - **Function Templates**: Allow creating functions that work with different data types.
   - **Class Templates**: Enable defining classes that work with different data types.
   - Templates are instantiated at compile time, ensuring type safety and performance.

---

## **2. Templates**

### **Definition**:
   - A template is a blueprint or formula for creating generic classes or functions.

### **Syntax**:
```cpp
template <typename T>
return_type function_name(T parameter) {
    // Function implementation
}
```

### **Example**:
#### Function Template:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

template <typename T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    cout << "Int: " << add(5, 3) << endl;          // Output: 8
    cout << "Double: " << add(2.5, 1.5) << endl;  // Output: 4
    return 0;
}
```

#### Class Template:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

template <typename T>
class Box {
    T value;

public:
    void setValue(T val) { value = val; }
    T getValue() { return value; }
};

int main() {
    Box<int> intBox;
    intBox.setValue(10);
    cout << "Int Box: " << intBox.getValue() << endl;  // Output: 10

    Box<double> doubleBox;
    doubleBox.setValue(3.14);
    cout << "Double Box: " << doubleBox.getValue() << endl;  // Output: 3.14

    return 0;
}
```

---

## **3. Overloading Functions**

### **Definition**:
   - Function overloading allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.
   - The compiler determines the correct function to call based on arguments provided.

### **Example**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

double add(double a, double b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    cout << "Int: " << add(5, 3) << endl;          // Output: 8
    cout << "Double: " << add(2.5, 1.5) << endl;  // Output: 4
    return 0;
}
```

### **Key Points**:
   - Overloaded functions differ in the number or type of parameters.
   - Return type alone cannot be used to differentiate overloaded functions.

---

## **4. Template Functions**

### **Definition**:
   - Template functions are functions written with a generic type parameter that can be instantiated with any data type.

### **Syntax**:
```cpp
template <typename T>
T function_name(T parameter1, T parameter2) {
    // Function implementation
}
```

### **Example**:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

template <typename T>
T multiply(T a, T b) {
    return a * b;
}

int main() {
    cout << "Int: " << multiply(3, 4) << endl;           // Output: 12
    cout << "Double: " << multiply(2.5, 1.5) << endl;   // Output: 3.75
    return 0;
}
```
